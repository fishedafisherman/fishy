1: change how the website works, which means to make the website run on iframes so that the url is the same
through out so that you can't just bookmark the page and keep your progress!

2: add a alert system that ask's you key phrazes that you will find on each page through a button press
so that if you have the key phrazes then you can go back, this will mostly enshure that they somewhat had some effort in the puzzles!

IMPORTANT: draw a swole fish walking up to the camera holding a sign, and pulls up the sign to the  screen and shows the type of fish that I am!!! look: FBI tag, looks like a blue fish, walks on its fins, and has swols human arms with ear bud in one ??gill?? this should work!!
